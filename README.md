<h1> NumericalComputation </h1>

NumericalComputation is a Python package for scientific computing

It provides:
* Computational functions for common linear algebra problems
* Computational functions for solving ODEs
* Special functions from recent research papers in numerical analysis
* Support for M x N matricies and N x 1 vectors

It will soon include:
* Support for additional common linear aglebra problems
* More ODE related computations
* Fourier Transform Computations
* New algorithms from accepted research papers
* Custom errors
* More efficient code for already existing functions
* Better organization
