<h1> NumericalComputation </h1>

NumericalComputation is a Python package for scientific computing

It provides:
* Computational functions for common linear algebra problems
* Support for M x N matricies and N x 1 vectors

It will soon include:
* Support for additional common linear aglebra problems
* Custom errors
* More efficient code for already existing functions
